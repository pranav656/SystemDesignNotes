# Introduction
Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where 
significant is measured by the cost of change. - Grady Booch
A good architectuer comes from understanding it more as a journey than a destination, more as
a process of enquiry than a frozen artifact.
Architecture rules are the same across systems from different domains.
The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and
maintain a system. If the effort is low and stays low, the design is good. If the effort grows,
the system is bad. 
High level decisions and low level details are intertwined. 
The only way to go fast is to go well.
Software should be easy to change, that's why it's called soft. If it's hard to change, then it's called hardware.
There are four aspects:
1. Urgent and Important
2. Not urgent and Important
3. Urgent and Non important
4. Not urgent and not important

Business managers tend to think classify tasks in third block as tasks in first block. Architecture is always important.
Development teams need to guard the architecture.
