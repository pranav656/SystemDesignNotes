Throughput: Number of transactions, samples, messages or similar terms that can be processed over time.

Responsiveness: It is usually captured by worst case execution times.

Predictability: Occuring over a range or defined by a probability distribution function.

Host: System where the embedded system is designed or executed.

Target: The execution platform.

Cross Compiler: It runs on the host but creates a target that runs in another OS/platform.

Linker: It combines a set of libraries into an executable for a target. Most embedded OSs require this step.

Loader: It loads the object image output from the linking step into the memory of the target environment.
