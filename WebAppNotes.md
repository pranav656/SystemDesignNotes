f# Basic working of a web app
Users use a mobile app or a website to access their services. The
browser/app obtains the IP address from the DNS (Domain Name Severs). Then a 
HTTP response are sent to the web srever. The webserver responds with a HTML page
or a with a JSON file. JSON is commonly used for the sake of a simple interface. 
A database is added as the webapp scales. The data bases can be relational or 
non-relational.
